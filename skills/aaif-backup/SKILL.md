description: Take a versioned local backup of critical AAIF ops data — the Community Intake Ops sheet by default, or any Drive file / local file you name. Snapshots are immutable and timestamped so you keep a full history. Use when asked to back up / snapshot the intake data (or another file) before a risky edit.

# Backup AAIF Ops Data

Snapshot irreplaceable data to **local, versioned files** before risky edits (a bulk
clean, a schema change, a column move). Every run writes a **new immutable file** —
nothing is ever overwritten — so the backup folder is a full version history you can
diff or restore from.

Prereq: the `gws` CLI must be installed and authenticated (`gws-cli-access` memory) for
Drive targets. Local-file backups need no auth.

## Usage (engine: `scripts/backup.py`)

```bash
# default — back up the AAIF Community Intake Ops sheet (exported to .xlsx)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/backup.py

# back up any Drive file by id (native Docs/Sheets/Slides -> .docx/.xlsx/.pptx)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/backup.py <driveFileId>

# back up a local file (copied verbatim)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/backup.py ./path/to/file.xlsx

# write snapshots somewhere other than ./backups
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/backup.py --dest /some/dir
```

## Where snapshots land

```
<dest>/<slug>/<UTC-timestamp>.<ext>
   e.g.  backups/aaif-community-intake-ops/2026-07-03T142530Z.xlsx
```

- `<dest>` defaults to **`./backups`** (relative to where you run it — inside the
  `meetups/` repo when run from there). `backups/` is **git-ignored**, so the binary
  snapshots never enter the repo.
- Filenames are UTC timestamps, so a folder listing is the version history in order.
- The target's type decides the format: a Google Sheet is exported to `.xlsx`, a Doc to
  `.docx`, Slides to `.pptx`; already-binary Drive files and local files are copied as-is.

## Restore (manual)

There's no automated restore — it's a deliberate, eyes-open step:
1. Pick the snapshot you want from `backups/<slug>/`.
2. Re-upload it over the live file with `gws drive files update`
   (`--upload <file> --upload-content-type <mime>`), or open the `.xlsx`/`.docx` and
   copy the needed cells/sections back by hand.
   For the Intake Ops sheet, prefer copying values back over replacing the file so the
   role-tab formulas and conditional formats stay intact.

## Notes

- Default target is the Intake Ops sheet (id `1cWkjCI5AGK9RX_fs23P5jRA4I2nixgnHuapvwHseZ5o`),
  the one source of applicant data that can't be regenerated.
- Run this **before** `aaif-clean-data apply` or any bulk sheet edit.
- Snapshots accumulate; prune old ones by hand if the folder grows large.
