# AAIF Attendee Reminder

Sent to RSVPs ~1 week out and the morning of. Short, logistics-first (~70 words).
**Lead with date, time, and exact venue / entry.** One line on the speaker. **End
by asking them to update their RSVP if plans change** so the seat can be released.

**House voice:** warm, concrete, builder-to-builder. Signal, not numbers.

**Standard footer (always include).** After the RSVP line, append one quiet line
with the two standing AAIF attendee links (defaults on every reminder), e.g.
*"Reminder: our Code of Conduct
(events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct) and Privacy Policy
(linuxfoundation.org/legal/privacy-policy) apply."* This sits outside the ~70-word
body count.

## Input (from the event tracker)

> Chen opens with tool calling at 10M requests a day, then three quick community
> demos. If your plans change, please update your RSVP so we can pass your seat to
> the waitlist. See you there.
>
> Reminder: our Code of Conduct (events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct)
> and Privacy Policy (linuxfoundation.org/legal/privacy-policy) apply.
