# Clean AAIF Intake Data

Normalize the intake data **without silently changing it**: detect issues, propose
fixes with a before→after diff, and only write when the user approves. Fixes are
applied to the **source** tab `Form Responses` (id `1cWkjCI5AGK9RX_fs23P5jRA4I2nixgnHuapvwHseZ5o`)
so the cleaned values flow through to the computed role tabs. Every applied change
is noted per row in an **`Autofixes`** column on `Form Responses` (created on first
use) — provenance for what the cleanup touched.

Prereq: the `gws` CLI must be installed and authenticated (`gws-cli-access` memory).
See `aaif-intake-ops-sheet` memory for the sheet's structure. All reads/writes go
by **header name**, never column letter.

## The modes (engine: `scripts/clean.py`)

1. **Scan (default, read-only)** — detect & propose:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clean.py scan        # human-readable
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clean.py scan --json # structured
   ```
   Mechanical fixes proposed automatically: trim/collapse whitespace, re-case
   clearly all-upper/all-lower names & cities, canonicalize LinkedIn URLs
   (`https://www.linkedin.com/in/...`, strip tracking params & trailing slash).
   Flags raised (need judgment): `City="Other"`, missing/invalid email, duplicate
   email, LinkedIn that isn't a profile URL, missing name.

2. **Apply (writes, on approval only)** — feed an approved change list:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clean.py apply changes.json
   ```
   `changes.json` is `[{"row": <source row>, "header": "<column>", "value": "<new>"}]`.
   Writes those cells in `Form Responses` and notes what changed per row in the
   `Autofixes` column.

3. **Install-flags (maintenance)** — add/refresh the live error flag:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clean.py install-flags
   ```
   Adds an `Issues` column (live `ARRAYFORMULA`) to each role tab plus a
   top-priority conditional rule that turns the whole row **bright red** whenever
   there's a genuine error — **missing/invalid email or a broken LinkedIn URL**. It
   auto-clears once fixed, and is distinct from the light-red "Denied" status.
   `City="Other"` is deliberately **NOT** an error (it's a normalization to resolve,
   surfaced by `scan`), so it never turns a row red. Already installed — re-run only
   to refresh after a column move.

4. **Install-colors (maintenance)** — label the two city columns and provenance-color
   the role tabs:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clean.py install-colors
   ```
   Labels col G **`City (Existing)`** / col H **`City (New)`** and installs three
   rules just **under** the bright-red error rule (so errors keep top priority):
   **violet** whole-row when `Status = "Existing (from MLOps)"`, **amber** on
   `City (New)` when it has a value (a net-new resolved city), and **green** on
   `City (Existing)` when it holds a real city (non-empty, not "Other"). Idempotent —
   it matches and refreshes its own rules by formula, safe to re-run after a column
   move. `install-flags` now also runs this, so one command does the full setup.

## Procedure

1. **Scan** and show the user the proposed mechanical fixes and the flags, grouped
   and skimmable. Lead with anything that blocks usability (missing/invalid email).
2. **Resolve judgment flags yourself before asking the user to.** For each
   `City="Other"` row, read that person's free-text in `Form Responses` (their
   "Why organize / ties", "Have you helped run events before?", LinkedIn, etc.) and
   infer the real city — e.g. Bangalore, Frankfurt, Luxembourg. Write the inferred
   value into the **`Resolved City`** source column (now at `CF`; shown in the role
   tabs as **`City (New)`**), **never overwrite the submitted `City` dropdown**
   (shown as **`City (Existing)`**) — that's the non-destructive rule. `City (New)`
   holds **only net-new cities** (rows where `City = "Other"`); existing form cities
   stay in `City (Existing)` and must **not** be copied across. A row stops being
   flagged once `Resolved City` is filled. Don't guess with no signal.
3. **Confirm with the user** which fixes to apply. Mechanical fixes are safe to
   batch; city resolutions should be eyeballed since they're inferred.
4. **Build `changes.json`** (rows + header names + new values) and run `apply`.
   Re-run `scan` to confirm the diff shrank and check the `Autofixes` column.
5. Mechanical fixes are idempotent — running scan again after apply should show
   them gone.

## Notes & guardrails

- **Never** edit the role tabs' computed columns; fixes go to `Form Responses`.
- Name re-casing only triggers on clearly all-upper/all-lower input (won't mangle
  "McDonald", "von Neumann"); when unsure it leaves the value alone — verify odd ones.
- Don't sort/insert rows in `Form Responses` (breaks row alignment everywhere).
- Duplicate-email flag surfaces repeat submissions; decide which row wins before
  acting — the engine won't merge or delete rows.
