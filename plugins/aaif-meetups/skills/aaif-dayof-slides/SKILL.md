# AAIF Day-of Slides (from the tracker)

Turn an event's tracker entry into the text for the chapter's **"Day of Event"**
deck (`Event Name/Slides.pptx`). Fill the per-event slides from the tracker and
**leave the fixed brand slides** (`[FIXED]`: About AAIF, the global-network stats)
**exactly as written** — they are brand-standard.

Keep it **terse and label-driven** (the deck voice). Output as `Slide N — <name>:`
then the fields, slide for slide, then paste into the template.

- Event : `[EVENT TITLE]`   Series: `[SERIES]`   Theme: `[THEME + ONE-LINER]`
